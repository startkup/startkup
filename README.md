Adding or updating git submodules
----------------------------

0. Read the [documentation] on the process for adding new submodules.
1. In some cases, the submodules might include not needed files (e.g. test files,
   project files, etc). If you cannot exclude them from submodules's archive
   (e.g. by `export-ignore`ing unwanted files in submodules's `.gitattributes`
   file), you can skip checking them in by listing them in `.gitignore` file.
2. Add and commit changes as a git patch.
3. Review and merge changes.

If in doubt, seek advice from regular commiters to this repository.
